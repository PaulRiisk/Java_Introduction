# Java Introduction Course 
## About This Project

This repository serves as a structured summary of my learning journey through the Java Introduction Course by @Modding by Kaupenjoe. \
The goal of this project is to refresh my Java skills while reinforcing key programming concepts through hands-on coding exercises. \
## Project Structure 

The repository **consists of 27 packages,** categorized by fundamental Java topics. Each package contains Java classes that demonstrate key concepts, such as:

    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism
    Java Basics: Data types, Operators, Conditionals, Loops
    Advanced Concepts: Lambda expressions, Generics, Exception Handling
    Input & Output: Reading and writing files in Java
    Exercises: Three practical exercises to apply the learned concepts

All code is written by me, with inspiration and guidance from the course material.
## How to Use This Repository

    Clone the repository
    Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or another Java IDE.
    Navigate through the packages and explore the Java implementations.
    Run the individual .java files to see them in action.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout this course, I revisited important Java programming concepts, including:

âœ… Mastering Java syntax and structure \
âœ… Implementing object-oriented principles effectively \
âœ… Handling errors and exceptions \
âœ… Working with Java Collections and Streams  
âœ… Writing cleaner and more efficient code
